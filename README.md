# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

(It does not work yet)

# Armoured Combat Framework :

The Armoured Combat Framework is a [Garry's Mod][] addon which creates a balanced, realistic and fun to play combat damage system, simulating projectiles, armor and explosions, as well as engines and gearboxes.

Original ACF are needed to run the Custom mod and you can get the Original ACF [HERE][].
